-- Write your own iterate and unfoldr

-- 1. Write myIterate using direct recursion

myIterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
myIterate f x = x:(myIterate f (f x))

-- OMG I MADE IT WORK -> No need for the [],
-- it will never be evaluated.

-- 2. Write myUnfoldr using direct recursion

myUnfoldr :: (b -> Maybe (a, b)) -> b -> [a]
myUnfoldr f x =
    case (f x) of
      Just (a, b) -> a : myUnfoldr f b
      Nothing -> []

-- IN YOUR FACE

-- 3. Stuff that. Rewrite myIterate using unfoldr

betterIterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
betterIterate f = unfoldr (\x -> Just (x, f x))

-- Binary Tree

data BinaryTree a = Leaf
                  | Node (BinaryTree a) a (BinaryTree a)
                    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

-- 1. Write unfold for BinaryTree

unfold :: (a -> Maybe (a, b, a)) -> a -> BinaryTree b
unfold f x =
  case (f x) of
    Nothing -> Leaf
    Just (a, b, c) -> Node (unfold f a) b (unfold f c)

-- 2. Tree builder

treeBuild :: Integer -> BinaryTree Integer
treeBuild n =
  unfold (\x -> if x >= n
                then Nothing
                else Just (x+1, x, x+1)) 0
